# Performance

- Response time
 	- end time - start time
 	- how long do a **task**
- Throughput
 	- Total work done per **unit time**
- Focus on response time now

How can we affect Response time, Throughput by ...?

- Relative performance
  - Let $Performance = 1 / Executiontime$

### X is n time faster than Y

$Performance_x / Performance_y  = \\ Execution time_y / Execution time_x = n$

## Measuring Execution Time

- Elapsed time
  - Total response time (all aspects)
  - Determine entire system performance
- CPU time
  - Time spent processing a given job
  - **Not including other jobsâ€™ time**

## CPU clocking

- timing signal that pulses at a regular interval
- If cpu can have higher clock frequency, the response time can be reduced

### What is clock signal?

- Operation of digital hardware is governed by a constant-rate clock
- clock cycle: 1 and 0 signal
- clock period
  - duration of each one clock cycle
- clock frequency(rate): clock cycles per second

$$
CPUtime = CPU clock cycles * Clock period \\
= \frac{CPUclock cycles}{Clock frequency}
$$

$$
Clock Cycles = Cycles per Instruction * Instruction Count
$$

$$
CPUtime = \frac{Instruction Count * Cycles per Instruction}{clock rate}
$$

- all cycles needed * time for one clock cycle

## CPI

- Average CPI
  - if different instructions have different CPI
- average number of clock cycles each instruction takes to execute
- determined by computer architecture
- (number of instruction is same)

- If instructions are different, it takes different Clock cycles => Use average
- CPI is different in different for application and instruction type

## MIPS(IPS)

- MIPS: Millions of Instructions Per Second
- Doesn't consider number of instruction counts
- Even if MIPS can be higher, performance can not be always higher
- If number of instruction counts are same, you can compare performances by MIPS
