# Power trends

if consume of power reduces, cost also reduces
$power = load \times Voltage^2 \times Frequency$

- load: area of chip
- frequency: clock frequency
  - power is promotional to frequency

### meaning of power wall

- power is a limiting factor
  - can’t reduce voltage further
   - by reducing the size of transistor further
  - can’t remove more heat
  - implication of power wall => trend to multiprocessors

- power density(power consumption) is constant when Tr scales down

## The switch to multiprocessors

- power density(power consumption) is constant when Tr scales down
  - if Tr scales down, performance increase
  - => Good news?

- multicore microprocessors
  - multiple processors per chip

- problem
   - communication difficulties
   - some tasks cannot be divided (load balancing)
   - programming for performance (parallel programming is hard)

### SPEC CPU Benchmark

- Elapsed time to execute a selection of programs
- different from usual cpu time

## Moore's law

- performance(num of transistors) will double every two years
- i.e.) density of transistors per area increase exponentially
