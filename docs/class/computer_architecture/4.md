# Power trends

If performance increases, power also increases
$power = load(chip area) \times Voltage^2 \times Frequency$

- clock frequency is proportional to power consumption
- load: area of chip

### meaning of power wall

- power is a limiting factor
  - can’t reduce voltage further
  - by reducing the size of transistor further
  - can’t remove more heat
  - implication of power wall => trend to multiprocessors
- power density(power consumption) is constant when Tr scales down
  - means it is able to improve performance with constant power consumption
  - しかしこれ以上Trのサイズは小さくすることは難しい

## The switch to multiprocessors

- multicore microprocessors
  - multiple processors per chip
- it aims to improve 'throughput' (multiple tasks per unit time) by increasing numbers of workers
  - Because of difficulty improving response time(clock frequency)

- problem
  - communication difficulties
  - some tasks cannot be divided (load balancing)
  - programming for performance (parallel programming is hard)

### SPEC CPU Benchmark

- Elapsed time to execute a selection of programs
- different from usual cpu time

### SPEC Power benchmark

- Performance per power

## Moore's law

- performance(num of transistors) will double every two years
- i.e.) density of transistors per area increase exponentially
