# Automata

- an abstract model of a digital computer

## finite automata

- a finite set of internal states
  - e.g)
   - if person in front, then open
   - it should open long enough
   - the door should not strike someone standing behind it

### deterministic finite automata(DFA)

- including start state and final state

### Nondeterministic finite automata(NFA)

- dfa: no duplicate transitions
- nfa: can contain multiple transitions
  - Multiple or none (𝜆-transition) transitions possible

- Why nfa is needed?
  - for .......100
