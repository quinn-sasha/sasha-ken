# Automata

- an abstract model of a digital computer

## finite automata

- a finite number of internal states

### deterministic finite automata(DFA)

- start state to final state
- one state -> another state by 1) current state and 2) imput symbol
- output: Accept or Reject

### Regular language

L is regular iff a DFA M such that

$$L = L(M)$$
e.g) $L = \{awa: w \in \{a, b\}^* \}$

### Nondeterministic finite automata(NFA)

- dfa: no duplicate transitions
- nfa: can contain multiple transitions
  - Multiple or none (ùúÜ-transition) transitions possible

#### Acceptance of Language by NFA

Different part form DFA: condition

$\delta^*(q_0, w) \cap F \neq \varnothing$

It says it will be accepted if intersection of transition and final state(target) is not empty

## Every NFA has equivalent DFA

- NFA and DFA has same expression power

M1 and M2 are equivalent if both accept same language

$$NFA \geq DFA$$

## Optimze DFA

- Find distinguishable(Âå∫Âà•„Åß„Åç„Å™„ÅÑ) state and merge them

Indistinguishable if
$$
\delta ^ * (p, w) \in F \iff \delta ^ * (q, w) \in F
$$

If both p and q is in F by a transition and
   both p and q is not in F by same transiton
   then it is indistinquishable
