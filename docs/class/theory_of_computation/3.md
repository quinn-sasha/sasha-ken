# Set

- disjoint: $A \cap B = \varnothing$
- powerset:
  - the set of all subsets of a set
- cartesian product (**ordered** pairs)

## functions

- rules for assigning elements in one set to a unique element in another set
- $f: A \to B$
- A: Domain
- B: Range
- total function:
  - f(x) = x + 1 is total
  - g(x) = 1 / x is partial because 1 / 0 is not unique

# Graph & Tree

## Graph

- consisted with vertices and edges
- def: $G = (V, E)$ where $V =\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}  \space and \space E = \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_n\}$

- walk: sequence of edges
   - e.g.) $e_1, e_2$ or $\{(v_1, v_3), (v_3, v_1)\}$
- path: walk with no repeated edges
   - e.g.) $e_1, e_2$
- simple path: no repeated vertices
  - e.g.) $e_1, e_4$
- cycle: walk from vi to itself with no repeated edges
  - a kind of path
  - e.g.) $e_1, e_3, e_2$

## Tree

- directed graph with no cycles
- only one unique path from a node to leafs

# Proof

- proof by induction
  1. Prove it is true when n = 1
  2. Assuming it is true for n = k
  3. Then show it is also true for n = k + 1
- proof by contradiction
  1. To prove P is true, start with assuming P is false
  2. Show contradiction from the assumption result

# alphabets & strings

## alphabets

- finite, non-empty set of symbols
- e.g.) english alphabets
$\Sigma = \{ a, b, c \}$

## strings

- sequence of symbols
- e.g.) aaabbb, abcba
- empty string: $|\lambda| = 0$
- $\Sigma^*$: zero or more symbols from Z
- $\Sigma^+$: 1 or more
  - Not including $\lambda$

# Language & grammars

## Language

- A set of strings
- A subset of $\Sigma^*$
- a sting in language is called 'sentence'

- $L^R = \{w^R: w \in L \}$
- $L_1L_2 = \{ xy: x \in L_1, y \in L_2\}$
- $L^* = L^0 \cup L^1 \cup L^2 ...$ where $L^0  = \{ \lambda\}$ and $L^i$ as L concatenated itself i times
- $L^+$ is $L^*$ without $L^0$

## Grammers

- A set of rules used to define strings in language instead of listing all strings in language
- $G = (V, T, S, P)$
  - P: set of production
  - < production rules >
   - Specify how the grammar transforms one string into another
   - $x \to y$ where $x \in (V \cup T)^+$ and $y \in (V \cup T)^*$

- Grammar specifies a language
- The language of G: written L(G)
- e.g.) $L(G) = \{a^nb^n: n \geq 0\}$
