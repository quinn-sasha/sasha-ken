## Best practices by google


> 1. Clearly communicate what content or information is most important.
> 
> 2. Structure the prompt: Start by defining its role, give context/input data, then provide the instruction.
> 
> 3. Use specific, varied examples to help the model narrow its focus and generate more accurate results.
> 
> 4. Use constraints to limit the scope of the model's output. This can help avoid meandering away from the instructions into factual inaccuracies.
> 
> 5. Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts.
> 
> 6. Instruct the model to evaluate or check its own responses before producing them. ("Make sure to limit your response to 3 sentences", "Rate your work on a scale of 1-10 for conciseness", "Do you think this is correct?").
